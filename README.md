# cicd-reference-diagrams
This repository was created while writing a [blog post](https://theresnomon.co/insecure-by-default-kubernetes-cicd-reference-diagrams-bce31523d506) discussing
the lack of security in workflow diagrams for Continuous Integration
and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) environments, particularly as they
relate to [cloud native](https://thenewstack.io/10-key-attributes-of-cloud-native-applications/) environments.

## Structure:
`initial search results/` - Subdirectory with screenshots of the initial search results that started this.

## Repo Status
I'll be doing 3 phases of commits here:

* Initial: full-resolution screenshots of my first Google searches where I identified what I consider a problem (mostly complete with the initial commits June 16th 2020)
* Markups: Here I'll take the first representative workflow diagram in the search results from each of the cloud providers and mark it up so that folks get an idea of what it *should* look like (Targeting completion for June 19th, 2020)
* Maintenance: As others have suggestions or requests this project may expand. Terraform or CloudFormation plans, perhaps? (ongoing. Pull requests accepted ðŸ˜€)
